A repository of the questions &amp; answers invoked in the Solutions Presentation for team Conserval, fall '22.

Some interviews of three farmers -Mr Subhas Chander, Mr Inderjeet and Mr Rajneesh- in the Faridabad and Sonepat districts of Haryana, India was conducted by team members on November 16th, 2022. The farmers were asked questions in Hindi and their responses have been summarized below.

Question1: Which crops do you grow ?
Answer :  We mostly grow paddy, wheat and vegetables.

Question 2: Do you use fertilizer? If yes, what type of fertilisers do you use?
Answer : Yes, we use fertilizers. Urea is most commonly applied on the fields because of its high Nitrogen content. We also use Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) as it contains both Nitorgen and Phosphorous. 

Question 3: What according to them are the benefit of using fertilisers?
Answer : The fertilizers improve soil fertility there by enabling quicker and better crop yield. With the harvesting of each crop important nutrients are reduced from the soil. If we do not replenish the nutrients through application of fertilisers, crop yield will deteriorate with time. 

Question 4: What is your land holding area? 
Answer : The landholdings of the three farmers ranged from one acre to two acres.

Question 5: How much Urea is applied by them in their fileds?
Answer : Approximately 125-150 kilogram of Urea and DAP is applied to one acre land.

Question 6: Are you aware that more than 70-80 % of the Nitrogen present in the urea is lost into the atmosphere, run off etc?
Answer :  The farmers were unaware about the loss of such high percentage of nitrogen from the soil into the air, runoff etc.


Question 8:  Are you aware of the harmful effect use of excess nitrogen based fertiliser on the (i) soil quality and (ii) environment?
Answer :  No, they were not aware of the harmful effect of excess use of Nitrogen urea fertilizers to the soil and environment. 

Question 9: Are you aware of the steps that help in reducing the amount of fertilisers applied to the filed without effecting the outcome on yield? What steps are you taking to prevent loss of nitrogen based fertilizer?
Answer :  To mitigate the loss, fertilizers are being placed at the sub-surface layer.

Question 10: Are you aware of ‘mycorrhiza’? If yes, what is their role and what is the impact of excess Nitrogen on them and the soil quality?
Answer : No, they were not aware of the term mycorrhiza and the important role played by them in increasing nutrient and water uptake by the host plants. They were also not aware of the adverse impact excess application of Nitrogen based fertilizer has on them.   

Question 11: Has there been any knowledge sharing/sensitization done to inform you on the need to maintain good balance on the amount of nitrogen fertilisers used?
Answer:-  The farmers were deciding on the amount of urea fertilizer to be applied based on their individual experiences. No specific programme has been conducted to increase their awareness.
